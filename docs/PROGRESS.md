# Progress — Agent Loop State

Machine-readable state for the `underwars-iteration` workflow. The **Orient** agent reads this
file first every iteration and the **Land** agent updates it last. Keep it terse and factual.

Task-log convention: the **Commit** column holds the commit *subject* (which always starts with
the task ID); look up the SHA with `git log --oneline --grep "<task-id>:"`. `—` means
not-yet-committed.

## Current position

- **Phase:** 1 (MVP, GDD §14)
- **Milestone:** **M1 — World: IN PROGRESS** (opened by M1-T1). M0 — Bootstrap is **DONE** (closed
  by M0-T5): every §14 M0 deliverable is built (Godot project, GUT wired, `run_tests.sh`, EventBus,
  RulesLoader + `ruleset.json`, CI script, `decisions.md`), **both** §14 acceptance clauses pass
  headless, and the signal that reports clause (a) is itself proven against the false-green mode
  M0-T4 measured. **M1 is NOT done:** its §14 row lists five deliverables (HexMath, concentric-bowl
  generator, chunked MultiMesh renderer, camera rig, hex picking) and M1-T1 delivered the **first
  slice of the first one**; **none of the three §14 M1 acceptance criteria pass yet** (no golden
  mapgen test exists, no greybox/renderer exists to measure 60 fps on, no LOS code exists to
  property-test).
- **Next task:** M1-T2 — **HexMath slice 2: hex lines, rings/ranges, and LOS** (§4.1 "Line of sight
  uses standard hex line-drawing (lerp in cube space, round); a line is blocked by any Solid hex, or
  by any hex whose elevation exceeds **both** endpoints' elevation", §4.3, §11.2 `scripts/core/`
  — §11.2 names `Los` as a peer of `HexMath`, so LOS may warrant its own file). Slice 1's API is
  landed and stable (see the HexMath contract note below) — build on it, do not re-derive it.
  §11.1 determinism is the sharp edge here: cube-lerp rounding is the project's first place where
  a naive implementation reaches for floats. Prefer an integer formulation, or confine any rounding
  to a single final step (§11.1 round-half-up at the final step only) — `test_hex_math.gd`'s
  no-float source scan applies to `hex_math.gd` only, so a new file is not automatically covered:
  write the equivalent scan for it. Split if it approaches ~300 LOC (lines+rings first, LOS second).
  The remaining M1 deliverables (concentric-bowl generator §4.4, chunked MultiMesh renderer, camera
  rig, hex picking) follow; the **first golden in the project** lands with the mapgen terrain hash,
  so re-read §13.2/§13.6 on golden discipline before recording it.
- **Blockers:** none

| Milestone | Status | Acceptance criteria met |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 Bootstrap | **DONE** (2026-08-04, M0-T5) | **BOTH §14 acceptance clauses MET headless, checked against the §14 row this iteration** — (a) *sentinel suite green AND a deliberately failing sentinel makes `run_tests.sh` exit non-zero* (SETUP-2 amendment): `verify_harness.sh` exit 0 with **four** phases — A green, B failing canary, C syntactic parse error, D statically-impossible construct — each red phase non-zero **and naming its probe**, tree clean afterwards; (b) *invalid ruleset rejected with a line-numbered error*: pinned by `tests/unit/test_rules_loader.gd`, suite exit 0 at **Scripts 7 / Tests 62 / Passing 62 / Asserts 473** with the collected-script count equal to the `test_*.gd` count on disk. **ALL §14 M0 deliverables built:** Godot project, GUT wired, `run_tests.sh`, RulesLoader + `ruleset.json`, EventBus (M0-T3), CI script (M0-T4: `tools/ci.sh` + `tools/typecheck.sh` + the `project.godot` §11.3 gate), `decisions.md`.

Still to build: HexMath LOS/lines/rings (M1-T2), concentric-bowl generator (§4.4), chunked MultiMesh renderer, camera rig, hex picking. |

## Notes for the next iteration

- **Pick up:** **M1-T2 — HexMath slice 2: hex lines, rings/ranges, LOS** (§4.1 line-drawing +
  blocking prose, §4.3, §11.1, §11.2). Read §4.1/§4.3 before coding. §11.2 lists `Los` as a
  separate `scripts/core/` file next to `HexMath`, so LOS probably belongs in `scripts/core/los.gd`
  rather than growing `hex_math.gd`; lines and rings are pure geometry and fit either place — pick
  one and say why. Split if it approaches ~300 LOC.
  `scripts/` currently holds `sim/rules_loader.gd` + `sim/rules_error.gd`, `core/event.gd` +
  `core/event_bus.gd` and `core/hex_math.gd`, and nothing else, deliberately (§13.4: invent nothing
  ahead of its milestone). No GameState, Command, generator, renderer or map code exists yet, and
  **no concrete `Event` subclass exists** — those belong to the milestones that emit them. M1 is
  the first milestone allowed to add hex/map code and the first to record a **golden**.
- **HexMath contract (`scripts/core/hex_math.gd`, landed M1-T1) — the coordinate layer every later
  system indexes; read decisions.md M1-T1 (A)/(B) before extending it.** `class_name HexMath extends
  RefCounted`, **all-static, never instantiated**. Axial is a plain `Vector2i` (q, r), cube a plain
  `Vector3i` (x, y, z) — integer Variant built-ins, not Nodes, so §11.1 purity holds and a
  4,921-hex Large map allocates no per-hex objects. Full API (11 members, do not grow it casually):
  `DIRECTIONS` (`Array[Vector2i]`), `DIRECTION_NAMES` (`PackedStringArray`), `axial_to_cube`,
  `cube_to_axial`, `is_valid_cube`, `neighbor`, `neighbors`, `opposite`, `distance`,
  `is_within_radius`, `hex_count_for_radius`.
  - **Direction indices are FIXED and load-bearing** (§4.1): `0 E (+1,0)`, `1 NE (+1,-1)`,
    `2 NW (0,-1)`, `3 W (-1,0)`, `4 SW (-1,+1)`, `5 SE (0,+1)`; `opposite(i) == (i+3)%6`, which is a
    true geometric property here (`DIRECTIONS[i] + DIRECTIONS[opposite(i)] == ZERO` for all six).
    Rings, pathfinding and mapgen will all key off this order — **never reorder or rename it**.
    The "Flat-top hexes" phrase in §4.1 does **not** license renaming: hex-to-screen orientation is
    a renderer concern (decisions.md M1-T1 resolution **(A)**; keep that lettering — both
    `hex_math.gd` and `test_hex_math.gd` reference it).
  - `neighbors()` returns a **fresh** `Array[Vector2i]` per call — a `const Array` is not deeply
    immutable in GDScript, so a cached/shared return value is a cross-caller corruption hazard.
    Pinned by test (verified live by an adversarial mutation probe at Verify).
  - An **out-of-range direction index is the identity**: `neighbor(h, dir) == h` and
    `opposite(dir) == dir` for `dir` outside 0..5 — no crash, no assert abort headless
    (resolution **(B)**; keep the lettering).
  - **No map-size constant lives in the file** and a source-scan test mechanically forbids one
    (regex over `24|32|40|1801|3169|4921`). The §4.1 radii are tunable generator parameters and
    belong to `data/mapgen/*.json` (§4.4) at the generator task. `hex_count_for_radius` exposes only
    the formula `3*r*(r+1)+1`.
  - **Integer math only**, mechanically scanned: no float literal and no `float` token anywhere in
    the file; `distance` is `maxi(absi(dx), maxi(absi(dy), absi(dz)))` on cube coords, so it needs no
    division and carries no `@warning_ignore("integer_division")`.
  - **Arithmetic warning for anyone re-deriving distances by hand:** the M1-T1 task spec listed
    `distance((1,-3),(4,2)) == 5`; that was a **miscalculation**. With §4.1's mapping the cubes are
    `(1,2,-3)` and `(4,-6,2)`, delta `(-3,8,-5)`, so the answer is **8** (both closed forms agree).
    Re-derived independently three times. The test pins 8. Do not "fix" it back to 5.
- **The §11.3 static-typing gate is LIVE from M0-T4 — every `.gd` you write must pass it.** Read
  decisions.md M0-T4 for the full contract; the operational facts:
  - Run it with `bash tools/typecheck.sh` (all project `.gd` outside `addons/`), or just
    `bash tools/ci.sh` (gate + suite + non-fatal skips for the not-yet-built §13.1 tools). Both
    are hardened: `typecheck.sh` aggregates **all** failures (never stops at the first) and fails
    loudly if enumeration finds **zero** files; `bash tools/typecheck.sh --self-test` is its
    two-way proof and drives the **tool**, not a bare engine call.
  - Config lives in `project.godot`'s `[debug]` section: **46 warnings at level 2**, **3 at level
    0** (`unsafe_cast`, `unsafe_call_argument`, `return_value_discarded` — each justified in
    decisions.md M0-T4 item c), `res://addons` exempt via `directory_rules`, **no project tree
    exempt**. `tests/unit/test_typing_gate.gd` pins all of it, including an anti-rot test that goes
    red if a future Godot adds a warning **or if a warning name is typo'd** in `project.godot`
    (a typo registers as a brand-new setting). Downgrading anything requires a decisions.md entry.
  - **`inferred_declaration` and `untyped_declaration` are errors**, so `:=` and bare `var x = …`
    are both rejected — always write `var x: T = …`. **`integer_division` is an error too, and
    deliberately so** (§11.1 round-half-up): from M2 every intentional `int/int` division needs an
    explicit `@warning_ignore("integer_division")` at the site.
  - Trap that predates the gate and still bites: passing a `Variant` (e.g. `Array.pop_front()`,
    or a `get_property_list()` element) into a statically-typed parameter is a **hard parse error**,
    not a warning — the script fails to load, which in a test file is the silent-skip false green
    below. Assign through a typed local first.
- **EventBus contract (`scripts/core/event_bus.gd`, `scripts/core/event.gd`) — read
  decisions.md M0-T3 (a)–(f) before using it.** Public API: `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`emit`/
  `emit_all`/`clear`/`subscriber_count`/`is_dispatching`. Delivery is per-type registration order,
  oldest first; nested emits (and whole `emit_all` batches) are **queued FIFO**, never depth-first;
  the subscriber list is snapshotted per event with a liveness re-check, so `subscribe`/
  `unsubscribe`/`clear` inside a handler never affect the in-flight event; `subscribe` is
  idempotent per `(type, Callable)`; freed-target Callables are skipped and pruned. Handlers take
  exactly one `Event` parameter and their return value is ignored — the sim never queries observers.
  Event *types* are plain `StringName`s with **no whitelist anywhere in engine code** (§11.1's list
  ends in "…"); the test file enforces that by scanning both core files, so never write
  `hex_changed`/`unit_moved`/… as a literal in `scripts/core/` — doc comments are fine.
- **Constants are now data.** `data/ruleset.json` holds the full §12.1 constant set and
  `RulesLoader` (`scripts/sim/rules_loader.gd`) is the only sanctioned way to read it. Never
  re-type a §12.1 number as a literal in `.gd` code (§13.6) — go through
  `get_int` / `get_float` / `get_string` / `get_int_array` / `has` with a dotted path.
  Errors surface as `RulesError` (`line` 1-based, `path` dotted, `message`,
  `format_for(source)` → `"<source>:<line>: <message>"`). Line 0 means "file-level, no line" and
  is reserved for missing/unreadable files.
- The green signal is real and two-way: `bash tools/run_tests.sh` → exit 0 with
  **Scripts 8 / Tests 86 / Passing 86 / Asserts 835** (M1-T1 baseline; it was 7 / 62 / 62 / 473 at
  the close of M0 — the M0 tracker row above deliberately keeps that historical figure), and
  `bash tools/typecheck.sh` → exit 0 over **13** project `.gd` files, and
  `bash tools/verify_harness.sh` → exit 0
  with **four** phases (A green · B failing canary · C syntactic parse error · D
  statically-impossible construct), each red phase non-zero *and naming its probe*, self-cleaning
  via `trap`. Run both — plus `bash tools/typecheck.sh` and `bash tools/ci.sh` from M0-T4 onward.
  **Expect the Scripts/Tests totals to RISE as you add tests; they are enumerated, not hard-coded,
  so nothing needs updating when they do.**
- `tools/run_tests.sh` is the harness **contract** — make it pass, do not rewrite or weaken it
  (*strengthening* is permitted and is what M0-T5 did; every prior guard is kept verbatim and
  `tests/unit/test_run_tests_harness.gd` test 3 re-asserts all of them, so a weakening edit turns
  the suite red). Guards now in force: exits 2 while `project.godot` is missing (no longer
  reachable); exits 1 if GUT collects zero tests; runs `--import` before GUT (GUT 9.7.1 exits 0
  without that cache — decisions.md SETUP-2); refuses on `Nothing was run` / `does not exist` /
  `have not been imported` / **`Failed to load script`** / **`Ignoring script`**; and — the
  evasion-proof one — **enumerates every `tests/**/test_*.gd` on disk and requires each to appear
  in GUT's output AND GUT's own `Scripts` total to equal that count** (M0-T5). The
  `-ginclude_subdirs` flag stays load-bearing: dropping it collects **zero** scripts because no
  test sits directly in `res://tests` — verified by probe.
- **Naming rule your test files must obey, now mechanically enforced (§13.2):** GUT 9.7.1 only
  collects files named `test_*.gd` (`addons/gut/gut.gd:229`), recursively under `res://tests`. The
  M0-T5 disk enumeration uses that exact rule, so a `.gd` file under `tests/` **without** the
  `test_` prefix is invisible to both — and a *probe* without it proves nothing (that naming
  mistake is what confounded decisions.md M0-T4 item (i)).
- **Debt handoff for M7 / E4 / E5 — read when you build `sim_smoke.gd`, `content_cli.gd` or
  `balance_lab.gd`:** `tools/ci.sh` currently skips each of the three by a plain **file-existence**
  check. The moment one of those files lands, `ci.sh` stops skipping it and prints a NOTE that it
  does not know how to invoke it — **wiring the real invocation (with the §13.1 argument list) is
  part of the task that creates the file**, not a later cleanup.
- Godot is repo-local: `godot/Godot_v4.7-stable_win64_console.exe` — the ONLY binary any agent
  may use (decisions.md SETUP-3). Never the `godot` PATH shim.
- `project.godot` deliberately has **no** `run/main_scene` (no scene exists; a dangling path
  breaks `--import`). Its `[debug]` section is the §11.3 gate (M0-T4, above) and is **hand-written
  and `--import`-stable**: Godot re-saves it byte-identically, *including* lines whose value equals
  its own default — which is what makes the "explicitly off" exclusion assertions possible. Do not
  "tidy" those lines away.
- Commit the `.gd.uid` sidecars Godot 4.4+ generates next to each `.gd`; never commit `.godot/`
  (gitignored). `.json` data files get no `.import` sidecar in Godot 4.7.
- **Known risk — CLOSED by M0-T5 (kept here as the standing explanation, not an open item).** A
  GDScript **parse error inside a test file** silently un-collects that whole file while every
  other script still runs; before M0-T5 `run_tests.sh` exited 0 and printed "All tests passed!"
  with totals byte-identical to a healthy tree. It now exits 1 on both variants — the syntactic one
  (`var x: int = (`) and the statically-impossible one (`is Node` against a `RefCounted`, M0-T2's
  live case) — and `verify_harness.sh` Phases C/D re-prove that every run. **Correction you must
  not re-derive from the old note:** decisions.md M0-T4 item (i) claimed the syntactic variant
  prints *no diagnostic at all*; that was an artefact of a probe named `_verify_parse_error.gd`,
  which lacks GUT's `test_` prefix, so GUT never tried to load it. Both variants **do** print
  `Failed to load script` **and** `Ignoring script` when the file is named `test_*.gd`. See
  decisions.md M0-T5 items (a)–(c). Still true and still useful: `typecheck.sh` catches both
  variants independently, and `loader is Node` cannot be written in GDScript against a
  `RefCounted` — assert non-Node-ness via `get_class()` instead.
- **Godot 4.7 JSON facts** (probed on the pinned repo-local binary, twice, independently — the
  docs disagree, see decisions.md M0-T2): `JSON.get_error_line()` is **0-based** (RulesLoader
  normalizes to 1-based); the parser **accepts trailing commas**, so they are useless as a
  syntax-error fixture; every JSON number arrives as `TYPE_FLOAT`, even `1` — so int validation
  is "accept an integral float, reject a fractional one", never truncate.
- **Forward gap to resolve at M2 (not a bug now):** §4.2's terrain table gives Artificial Granite
  a dig yield of **+2 Stone**, but the §12.1 excerpt's `dig_yields` object omits
  `artificial_granite`. `data/ruleset.json` mirrors the §12.1 excerpt faithfully, so the key is
  deliberately absent and the schema does not require it. M2 (Dig & Economy) must add it, with
  its own decisions.md entry at that time.
- `data/ruleset.json` formatting is **load-bearing, not cosmetic**: line 1 is a lone `{` and each
  §12.1 top-level group occupies exactly one line, so schema-error line attribution is meaningful
  and the tests can compute expected line numbers from the fixture instead of magic constants.
  Re-pretty-printing it fully nested will break `tests/unit/test_rules_loader.gd`.
- **Small known weakness, deliberately left for a later task (M0-T5 item g):**
  `tests/unit/test_run_tests_harness.gd` test 1 checks the coverage guard sits before the final
  `exit "$CODE"` by comparing `find("Scripts") < rfind('exit "$CODE"')`, which a header comment
  satisfies. The behavioural proof (live Phases C/D + the negative control) covers the property
  today. Tightening it to anchor on the guard's own code line is a fine opportunistic fix; it was
  scope creep inside M0-T5.
- **Golden discipline, first exercised in M1:** no golden file exists yet. When M1 records the
  mapgen hash, §13.6 applies from that moment — a golden may be re-recorded **only** with a logged
  reason in `decisions.md` in the *same commit*. Get the seeded generation deterministic first
  (`state.rng` only, no `randi()`, stable iteration order, integer math), because a golden recorded
  over a nondeterministic generator is worse than none.
